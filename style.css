/*
 * This file is primarily for theme registration.
 *
 * The visual styling for this theme is loaded dynamically via functions.php
 * from the CSS files located in the /styles/ directory. This allows for
 * selectable "skins" from the WordPress Customizer.
 *
 * You can add global, foundational CSS here if needed, but it's
 * generally recommended to keep skin-specific styles in their own files.
